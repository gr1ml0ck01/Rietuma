Across the small field of tents a large firepit blazes as a man in a smock prepares food for the weary soldiers. Officers watch on from their tents, or closer to their soldiers, barking orders at them. Various racks of weapons and shields lay close to a hut where a quartermaster works on polishing and sharpening the various tools of war. The atmosphere is full of organized chaos as soldiers train for combat.*\n\n**Defenses**\nThis area is constantly patrolled by the King's Royal Guards, the City guard, and the Kursan military. As well, many officers and mercenaries visit the camp regularly. Once every day, a procession of Elian acolytes come through to help tend to the wounded within the camp as well.\n\n**Daily Training**\nOnce per day, players may aid the officers within the camp. This roll is done in this channel. Consult the below table for the rewards garnered from your training. This roll counts towards one of your three daily activity rolls.",
