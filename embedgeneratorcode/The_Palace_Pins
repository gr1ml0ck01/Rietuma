      "description": "üè∞ **__The Palace__**\tüè∞\n\n*A vast complex of buildings made of stone, wood, and brick. The palace is the newest addition to New Rigan. It is a shining example of the best architecture of the local artisans. The spires tower above the tree-line, the grounds are constantly alive with people, and inside the murmurs of advisors can be heard speaking on all manner of topics.*\n\n**Layout**\nThe central structure holds the throne room and rooms for guests and royalty. The East wing connects the #royal-library while the West wing connects #the-forge. The complex also includes a #military-camp nearby to make defending the structure easier. As well an orphanage is close at hand so that it too may share in the palace's defenses.\n\n**Defenses**\nThis area is constantly patrolled by the King's Royal Guards and his Miracle of Unicorns. As well, the grounds and buildings are under the effect of the following spells:\n[Private Sanctum](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/private-sanctum)\n[Forbiddance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/forbiddance)\n[Hallow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hallow) *Creatures that are Celestials are excluded from the effects of the Hallow.*",
